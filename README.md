## How to run

All tasks can be found in [Labs.ipynb](../main/Labs.ipynb).
This notebook contains 4 sections; General, and one section for each lab.  
The General-section has to be run first as this includes all imports.  

There are 4 libraries used that were not covered in the tutorial notebook. These are easiest installed with the following pip commands:  

pip install seaborn  
pip install opencv-python  
pip install datasets  
pip install sklearn
